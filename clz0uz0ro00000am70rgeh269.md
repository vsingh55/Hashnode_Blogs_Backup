# The Role of Jenkins in Modern CI/CD Pipelines

In today's fast-paced software development landscape, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) have become essential practices for delivering high-quality software efficiently and reliably. At the heart of many CI/CD pipelines lies Jenkins, an open-source automation server that facilitates the automation of various stages of software development, from building and testing to deployment and monitoring.

## Overview of Jenkins: A Versatile Tool for DevOps Engineers

Jenkins is a key part of CI/CD pipelines, helping development teams automate and simplify their workflows. By working with various tools and technologies, Jenkins automates repetitive tasks, improves code quality, and speeds up software delivery. Its strong plugin ecosystem allows Jenkins to be customized for any project's specific needs, making it a versatile tool for DevOps engineers.

### Importance of Configuring Plugins: Unlocking Jenkin's Full Potential

The real strength of Jenkins comes from its wide range of plugins. These plugins let Jenkins work with other tools and services, making it more powerful and efficient. Setting up these plugins correctly is key to getting the most out of Jenkins in your CI/CD pipeline. Plugins are important at every step of the development process, from source control and project management to build automation and security scanning.

### Essential Tools for a Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline

In this blog, we will explore how to install and configure Jenkins plugins for a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that incorporates several essential tools:

* **Git**: For version control, enabling efficient source code management.
    
* **Jira**: For project management and issue tracking, ensuring smooth collaboration and task tracking.
    
* **Maven**: For build automation, particularly useful in Java projects.
    
* **SonarQube**: For code quality analysis, helping to maintain high standards in codebases.
    
* **Docker**: For containerization, facilitating consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
    
* **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration, managing deployments at scale.
    
* **Trivy**: For security scanning, identifying vulnerabilities in container images.
    
* **Blackbox Exporter**: For monitoring endpoints, ensuring application availability.
    
* **Prometheus**: For metrics collection, providing insights into system performance.
    
* **Grafana**: For data visualization, creating informative and actionable dashboards.
    

## Provisioning Infrastructure:

* If you are familiar with IaC tools like Terraform, installing all the required tools like Docker and Trivy during provisioning will be easy.
    
* You can use `user_data` on Azure Cloud and the `metadata` function on GCP during provisioning. Whether you use IaC (Terraform) or do it manually, you can still use the scripts.
    
    * Here is a [repository](https://github.com/vsingh55/DevOps-Toolbox.git) where you can find the scripts needed to install the tools. I will keep it updated, so feel free to fork or star it.
        
        %[https://github.com/vsingh55/DevOps-Toolbox.git] 
        
* You may also use an existing [Git repository](https://github.com/vsingh55/Terraform-Modules-Azure.git) that contains modular Terraform code. I will keep it updated, so feel free to fork or star it.
    
    %[https://github.com/vsingh55/Terraform-Modules-Azure.git] 
    
* I recommend visiting the blog to understand what a modular approach to Terraform code looks like and how it is executed.
    

%[https://blogs.vijaysingh.cloud/modular-terraform] 

* If you have basic knowledge of modular Terraform, you can refer to the mini [project blog](https://blogs.vijaysingh.cloud/automate-aks) listed below. It will also serve as a hands-on project for securely provisioning AKS using Terraform and Service Principal.

## Setting Up Jenkins:

* **Java**: As Jenkins requires Java to run so use java.sh.
    
* **Operating System**: Jenkins can be installed on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    
* <div data-node-type="callout">
    <div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
    <div data-node-type="callout-text">I usually use Ubuntu, so the scripts and provisioning codes are set up accordingly.</div>
    </div>
    

1. **Access Jenkins**:
    
    * Open a web browser and navigate to `http://<your_server_ip>:8080`.
        
    * You will be prompted to unlock Jenkins. Find the initial admin password using:
        
        ```bash
        sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
        ```
        
2. **Getting**`InitialAdminPassword`**:**
    
    ```bash
    ssh -i <path/to/publickey> username@VMpublicIP 
    sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    ```
    
3. **Complete Setup**:
    
    * Enter the initial admin password on *<mark>Jenkins web UI </mark>* \[`http://<your_server_ip>:8080`\] to unlock Jenkins.
        
    * Follow the on-screen instructions to install recommended plugins.
        
    * Create your first admin user and complete the setup wizard.
        

Once the initial setup is complete, you can tailor Jenkins to meet the specific requirements of your project. Let's proceed to set up the necessary plugins, tools, and system configurations that you require.

## Setting Up Essential Plugins

The process will be categorized in the following sections:

1. **Required Tools** to be installed on the server or virtual machine.
    
2. The configuration process within Jenkins.
    
    1. **Install Essential Plugins**
        
    2. **Set Up Credentials**

    * Git - If the repository is public, add credentials in the same manner as Docker, using a username and password. If the repository is private, you will need to obtain a GitHub personal access token and add the credential using the secret text "kind".
        
    * Jira (e.g., Jira username and password)
        
    * Kubernetes - Select "kind" is secret, print kubeconfig file from provisioned kubernetes and paste all the content in place of secret.
